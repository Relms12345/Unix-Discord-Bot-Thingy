# Unix-Based Discord Bot
## WARNING: THIS BOT IS DEFINITELY NOT TO BE USED IN ACTUAL SERVERS DUE TO HOW SCUFFED/BROKEN IT IS!

### This is a Discord bot where its commands attempt to follow basic Unix and Unix-Like commands as closely as possible (some things its kinda hard to be one on one with the unix equivalent). This idea came from another server and I decided why not make it. The code is messy asf and I probably won't bother fixing it up much cuz this is more of a Proof-Of-Concept.

### The code is very very scuffed and probably broken as well. PRs and Issues are welcome to fix bugs/add new features. (I promise my normal code is much much better then this mess lol)

#### The code is Licenced under the `Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License` and hence, do wtf you want with the code lol idc.

TODO:
 - Check perms
 - Add bunch more commands like chmod, chown (idk how i'll add that tbh lol), usermod, userdel etc. Basically most of the normal management cmds found in unix based systems
 - Help command
 - slash cmds when djs v13 releases them so i can have better looking code
